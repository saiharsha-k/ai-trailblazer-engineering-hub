# ML Engineering Mastery

ML Engineering Mastery is a concept-first, project-backed reference for becoming a production-focused Machine Learning Engineer.

## What This Repo Covers

- Foundations for data, stats, and Python for ML
- Data preparation and feature engineering (problem agnostic)
- Classical ML: classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction
- Model evaluation, workflows, and automation
- MLOps fundamentals: experiment tracking, data/model versioning
- Production patterns: batch inference, online serving, monitoring

## Who It Is For

- Aspiring ML Engineers
- Data Scientists moving toward production systems
- AI Engineers who want stronger ML and MLOps fundamentals

## Start Here

- Read the main `README.md`
- Follow the `roadmap/ml-engineering-roadmap.md`
- Pick one concept folder, read `notes.md`, then build an example project
