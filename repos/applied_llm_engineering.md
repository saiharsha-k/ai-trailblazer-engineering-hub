# Applied LLM Engineering

Applied LLM Engineering focuses on building real Large Language Model applications, from prompts to production systems.

## What This Repo Covers

- Practical prompt engineering patterns
- Fine-tuning and post-training for LLMs
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems and search
- AI agents and tool-calling workflows
- Evaluation, observability, and LLMOps practices
- Cost, latency, and reliability optimization

## Who It Is For

- AI Engineers and ML Engineers working with LLMs
- Developers building chatbots, assistants, or RAG apps
- Learners who want end-to-end, code-first LLM projects

## Start Here

- Read the main `README.md`
- Check the `roadmap/llm-engineering-roadmap.md` (if present)
- Run a basic LLM app, then explore RAG and agent folders
